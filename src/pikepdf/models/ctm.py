    being 3x3 matrixes). Initial matrix is the identity matrix unless overridden.

    Furthermore can the CTM be stored to the stack via the 'q' operator.
    This save the CTM and subsequent 'cm' operators change a copy of that CTM
    --> 'q 1 0 0 1 0 0 cm'

    1. Popping from an empty stack results in CTM being set to the initial matrix
    2. Multiplying with invalid operands sets the CTM to invalid
    3. Multiplying an invalid CTM with a valid CM results in an invalid CTM

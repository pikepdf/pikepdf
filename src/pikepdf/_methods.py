    This monkeypatches all methods defined in the support class onto an
    existing class. Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        @augments(ClassDefinedInCpp)
        class SupportClass:
            def foo(self):
                pass

    The Python method 'foo' will be monkeypatched on ClassDefinedInCpp. SupportClass
    has no meaning on its own and should not be used, but gets returned from
    this function so IDE code inspection doesn't get too confused.

    We don't subclass because it's much more convenient to monkeypatch Python
    methods onto the existing Python binding of the C++ class. For one thing,
    this allows the implementation to be moved from Python to C++ or vice
    versa. It saves having to implement an intermediate Python subclass and then
    ensures that the C++ superclass never 'leaks' to pikepdf users. Finally,
    wrapper classes and subclasses can become problematic if the call stack
    crosses the C++/Python boundary multiple times.

    Any existing methods may be used, regardless of whether they are defined
    elsewhere in the support class or in the target class.

    For data fields to work, the target class must be
    tagged ``py::dynamic_attr`` in pybind11.

    Strictly, the target class does not have to be C++ or derived from pybind11.
    This works on pure Python classes too.

    THIS DOES NOT work for class methods.

        Args:
            filename_or_stream: Where to write the output. If a file
                exists in this location it will be overwritten.
                If the file was opened with ``allow_overwriting_input=True``,
                then it is permitted to overwrite the original file, and
                this parameter may be omitted to implicitly use the original

                input file, as overwriting the input file would corrupt data
                since pikepdf using lazy loading.

            static_id: Indicates that the ``/ID`` metadata, normally
                calculated as a hash of certain PDF contents and metadata
                including the current time, should instead be generated
                deterministically. Normally for debugging.
            preserve_pdfa: Ensures that the file is generated in a
                manner compliant with PDF/A and other stricter variants.
                This should be True, the default, in most cases.

            min_version: Sets the minimum version of PDF
                specification that should be required. If left alone QPDF
                will decide. If a tuple, the second element is an integer, the
                extension level. If the version number is not a valid format,
                QPDF will decide what to do.
            force_version: Override the version recommend by QPDF,
                potentially creating an invalid file that does not display
                in old versions. See QPDF manual for details. If a tuple, the
                second element is an integer, the extension level.
            fix_metadata_version: If ``True`` (default) and the XMP metadata
                contains the optional PDF version field, ensure the version in
                metadata is correct. If the XMP metadata does not contain a PDF
                version field, none will be added. To ensure that the field is
                added, edit the metadata and insert a placeholder value in
                ``pdf:PDFVersion``. If XMP metadata does not exist, it will
                not be created regardless of the value of this argument.

            object_stream_mode:
                ``disable`` prevents the use of object streams.
                ``preserve`` keeps object streams from the input file.
                ``generate`` uses object streams wherever possible,
                creating the smallest files but requiring PDF 1.5+.

            compress_streams: Enables or disables the compression of
                stream objects in the PDF that are created without specifying
                any compression setting. Metadata is never compressed.
                By default this is set to ``True``, and should be except
                for debugging. Existing streams in the PDF or streams will not
                be modified. To decompress existing streams, you must set
                both ``compress_streams=False`` and ``stream_decode_level``
                to the desired decode level (e.g. ``.generalized`` will
                decompress most non-image content).

            stream_decode_level: Specifies how
                to encode stream objects. See documentation for
                :class:`pikepdf.StreamDecodeLevel`.

            recompress_flate: When disabled (the default), qpdf does not
                uncompress and recompress streams compressed with the Flate
                compression algorithm. If True, pikepdf will instruct qpdf to
                do this, which may be useful if recompressing streams to a
                higher compression level.

            normalize_content: Enables parsing and reformatting the
                content stream within PDFs. This may debugging PDFs easier.

            linearize: Enables creating linear or "fast web view",
                where the file's contents are organized sequentially so that
                a viewer can begin rendering before it has the whole file.
                As a drawback, it tends to make files larger.

            qdf: Save output QDF mode.  QDF mode is a special output
                mode in QPDF to allow editing of PDFs in a text editor. Use
                the program ``fix-qdf`` to fix convert back to a standard
                PDF.

            progress: Specify a callback function that is called
                as the PDF is written. The function will be called with an
                integer between 0-100 as the sole parameter, the progress
                percentage. This function may not access or modify the PDF
                while it is being written, or data corruption will almost
                certainly occur.

            encryption: If ``False``
                or omitted, existing encryption will be removed. If ``True``
                encryption settings are copied from the originating PDF.
                Alternately, an ``Encryption`` object may be provided that
                sets the parameters for new encryption.

        Raises:
            PdfError
            ForeignObjectError

        You may call ``.save()`` multiple times with different parameters
        to generate different versions of a file, and you *may* continue
        to modify the file after saving it. ``.save()`` does not modify
        the ``Pdf`` object in memory, except possibly by updating the XMP
        metadata version with ``fix_metadata_version``.

        .. note::

            :meth:`pikepdf.Pdf.remove_unreferenced_resources` before saving
            may eliminate unnecessary resources from the output file if there
            are any objects (such as images) that are referenced in a page's
            Resources dictionary but never called in the page's content stream.

        .. note::

            pikepdf can read PDFs with incremental updates, but always
            coalesces any incremental updates into a single non-incremental
            PDF file when saving.

        Open an existing file at *filename_or_stream*.

        If *filename_or_stream* is path-like, the file will be opened for reading.
        The file should not be modified by another process while it is open in
        pikepdf, or undefined behavior may occur. This is because the file may be
        lazily loaded. Despite this restriction, pikepdf does not try to use any OS
        services to obtain an exclusive lock on the file. Some applications may
        want to attempt this or copy the file to a temporary location before
        editing. This behaviour changes if *allow_overwriting_input* is set: the whole
        file is then read and copied to memory, so that pikepdf can overwrite it
        when calling ``.save()``.

        When this function is called with a stream-like object, you must ensure
        that the data it returns cannot be modified, or undefined behavior will
        occur.

        Any changes to the file must be persisted by using ``.save()``.

        If *filename_or_stream* has ``.read()`` and ``.seek()`` methods, the file
        will be accessed as a readable binary stream. pikepdf will read the
        entire stream into a private buffer.

        ``.open()`` may be used in a ``with``-block; ``.close()`` will be called when
        the block exits, if applicable.

        Whenever pikepdf opens a file, it will close it. If you open the file
        for pikepdf or give it a stream-like object to read from, you must
        release that object when appropriate.

        Examples:

            >>> with Pdf.open("test.pdf") as pdf:
                    ...

            >>> pdf = Pdf.open("test.pdf", password="rosebud")

        Args:
            filename_or_stream: Filename or Python readable and seekable file
                stream of PDF to open.
            password: User or owner password to open an
                encrypted PDF. If the type of this parameter is ``str``
                it will be encoded as UTF-8. If the type is ``bytes`` it will
                be saved verbatim. Passwords are always padded or
                truncated to 32 bytes internally. Use ASCII passwords for
                maximum compatibility.
            hex_password: If True, interpret the password as a
                hex-encoded version of the exact encryption key to use, without
                performing the normal key computation. Useful in forensics.
            ignore_xref_streams: If True, ignore cross-reference
                streams. See qpdf documentation.
            suppress_warnings: If True (default), warnings are not
                printed to stderr. Use :meth:`pikepdf.Pdf.get_warnings()` to
                retrieve warnings.
            attempt_recovery: If True (default), attempt to recover
                from PDF parsing errors.
            inherit_page_attributes: If True (default), push attributes
                set on a group of pages to individual pages
            access_mode: If ``.default``, pikepdf will
                decide how to access the file. Currently, it will always
                selected stream access. To attempt memory mapping and fallback
                to stream if memory mapping failed, use ``.mmap``.  Use
                ``.mmap_only`` to require memory mapping or fail
                (this is expected to only be useful for testing). Applications
                should be prepared to handle the SIGBUS signal on POSIX in
                the event that the file is successfully mapped but later goes
                away.
            allow_overwriting_input: If True, allows calling ``.save()``
                to overwrite the input file. This is performed by loading the
                entire input file into memory at open time; this will use more
                memory and may recent performance especially when the opened
                file will not be modified.
        Raises:
            pikepdf.PasswordError: If the password failed to open the
                file.

            FileNotFoundError: If the file was not found.

        Note:
            When *filename_or_stream* is a stream and the stream is located on a
            network, pikepdf assumes that the stream using buffering and read caches
            to achieve reasonable performance. Streams that fetch data over a network
            in response to every read or seek request, no matter how small, will
            perform poorly. It may be easier to download a PDF from network to
            temporary local storage (such as ``io.BytesIO``), manipulate it, and
            then re-upload it.

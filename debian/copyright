Comment:
 The file licenses/license.wheel.txt is relevant only when a binary
 artifact is produced from the combination of the source code of
 pikepdf and the source code of qpdf.  Nothing in pikepdf is Apache
 licensed.
 .
 pikepdf is licensed under the (unmodified) MPL-2.0.  This was always
 upstream's intention; the removal of the text of Exhibit B from the
 copy of the MPL included in the source package was a
 misunderstanding.  An upstream commit more recent than the currently
 packaged upstream version restores the usual text of the MPL-2.0;
 that commit is backported into the Debian delta queue, file
 debian/patches/0001-Restore-Exhibit-B-text-clarify-license-comments-in-r.patch

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
 extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
 Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 -- Definitions.
 .
  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 .
  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.
 .
  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.
 .
  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.
 .
  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.
 .
  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.
 .
  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and
 .
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
 .
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
 .
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.
 .
            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
 .
                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
 .
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.
 .
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
 .
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
 .
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
 other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
 derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
 literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
 cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
 recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
 derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
 Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
 this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
 timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
 Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
 as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
 broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
 in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
 arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
 which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
 with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
 independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
 collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
 considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
 License.
 .
 c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
 listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
 approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
 License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
 terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
 Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
 of adaptations of works made available under that license under this
 License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
 License Elements as this License.
 .
 d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
 copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
 other transfer of ownership.
 .
 e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
 attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this

 and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
 musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
 play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
 expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
 being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
 performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
 organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
 h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
 terms of this License including without limitation any production in
 the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode

 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
 steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
 were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
 marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
 a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
 incorporated in Collections; and,
 .

 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
 collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
 Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
 voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
 You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
 terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
 Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
 Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
 any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
 ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
 that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
 the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
 and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
 measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
 Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
 the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
 incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
 License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
 must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
 as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
 Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
 Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
 terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
 the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
 jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
 contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
 Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
 License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
 mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
 you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
 mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
 comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
 following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
 the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
 terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
 License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
 the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
 License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
 Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
 of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
 You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
 Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation
 from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
 Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
 the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
 the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
 or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
 or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
 extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
 specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
 refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
 and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
 Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
 (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
 "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
 required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
 Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
 contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
 part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
 credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
 doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
 purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
 Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
 assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
 Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
 of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
 written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
 take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
 prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
 agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
 of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
 make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
 modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
 Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
 as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
 applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
 right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
 but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
 Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
 licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
 full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
 Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
 the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
 not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
 been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
 and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
 terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
 same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
 License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
 this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
 Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
 amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
 Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
 of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
 jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
 according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
 those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
 standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
 includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
 additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
 License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
 applicable law.

     firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
     of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
     users, secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with
     which it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
     intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
     both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
 .
 The authors of the CeCILL license are:
 .
 Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific,
 technical and industrial research establishment, having its principal
 place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015
 Paris, France.

 Preamble
 .
 The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
 the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
 license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
 .
 The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations
 for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent
 redistributions.
 .
 In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
 modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided
 only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of
 the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited
 liability.
 .
 In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
 and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought
 to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may
 make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved
 for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
 knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
 suitability of the software as regards their requirements in
 conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be
 ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same
 conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
 published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are
 either added or removed herefrom.
 .
 This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder
 of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its
 provisions.

 entitlement to any or all compensation from the Licensor.
 .
 Article 9 - WARRANTY
 .
 9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
 state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
 possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
 possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
 attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
 modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
 reserved for experienced users.
 .
 The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
 the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
 order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either
 persons or properties.
 .
 9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
 to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
 rights set forth in Article 5).
 .
 9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
 the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
 that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any
 warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or
 relevant nature.
 .
 Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
 from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it
 will be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
 configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
 .
 9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
 Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
 relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
 the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
 arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
 instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of
 the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted
 against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and
 legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance
 shall be decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor
 and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The
 Licensor disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use
 of the name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the
 existence of prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards
 the existence of a trademark.
 .
 Article 10 - TERMINATION
 .
 10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
 hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
 thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
 remained ineffective.

 Paternité - Partage Des Conditions Initiales A l'Identique 2.0
 .
 Creative Commons n'est pas un cabinet d'avocats et ne fournit pas de
 services de conseil juridique. La distribution de la présente version
 de ce contrat ne crée aucune relation juridique entre les parties au
 contrat présenté ci-après et Creative Commons. Creative Commons
 fournit cette offre de contrat-type en l'état, à seule fin
 d'information. Creative Commons ne saurait être tenu responsable des
 éventuels préjudices résultant du contenu ou de l'utilisation de ce
 contrat.
 .
 Contrat
 .
 L'Oeuvre (telle que définie ci-dessous) est mise à disposition selon
 les termes du présent contrat appelé Contrat Public Creative Commons
 (dénommé ici « CPCC » ou « Contrat »). L'Oeuvre est protégée par le
 droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droit d'auteur, droits
 voisins, droits des producteurs de bases de données) ou toute autre
 loi applicable. Toute utilisation de l'Oeuvre autrement
 qu'explicitement autorisée selon ce Contrat ou le droit applicable est
 interdite.
 .
 L'exercice sur l'Oeuvre de tout droit proposé par le présent contrat
 vaut acceptation de celui-ci. Selon les termes et les obligations du
 présent contrat, la partie Offrante propose à la partie Acceptante
 l'exercice de certains droits présentés ci-après, et l'Acceptant en
 approuve les termes et conditions d'utilisation.
 .
 1. Définitions
 .
     « Oeuvre » : oeuvre de l'esprit protégeable par le droit de la
     propriété littéraire et artistique ou toute loi applicable et qui
     est mise à disposition selon les termes du présent Contrat.  «
     Oeuvre dite Collective » : une oeuvre dans laquelle l'oeuvre, dans
     sa forme intégrale et non modifiée, est assemblée en un ensemble
     collectif avec d'autres contributions qui constituent en
     elles-mêmes des oeuvres séparées et indépendantes. Constituent
     notamment des Oeuvres dites Collectives les publications
     périodiques, les anthologies ou les encyclopédies. Aux termes de
     la présente autorisation, une oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre dite
     Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée
     (telle que définie ci-après).  « Oeuvre dite Dérivée » : une
     oeuvre créée soit à partir de l'Oeuvre seule, soit à partir de
     l'Oeuvre et d'autres oeuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment
     des Oeuvres dites Dérivées les traductions, les arrangements
     musicaux, les adaptations théâtrales, littéraires ou
     cinématographiques, les enregistrements sonores, les reproductions
     par un art ou un procédé quelconque, les résumés, ou toute autre
     forme sous laquelle l'Oeuvre puisse être remaniée, modifiée,
     transformée ou adaptée, à l'exception d'une oeuvre qui constitue
     une Oeuvre dite Collective. Une Oeuvre dite Collective ne sera pas
     considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée aux termes du présent
     Contrat. Dans le cas où l'Oeuvre serait une composition musicale
     ou un enregistrement sonore, la synchronisation de l'oeuvre avec
     une image animée sera considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée
     pour les propos de ce Contrat.  « Auteur original » : la ou les
     personnes physiques qui ont créé l'Oeuvre.  « Offrant » : la ou
     les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) qui proposent la mise à
     disposition de l'Oeuvre selon les termes du présent Contrat.  «
     Acceptant » : la personne physique ou morale qui accepte le
     présent contrat et exerce des droits sans en avoir violé les
     termes au préalable ou qui a reçu l'autorisation expresse de
     l'Offrant d'exercer des droits dans le cadre du présent contrat
     malgré une précédente violation de ce contrat.  « Options du
     Contrat » : les attributs génériques du Contrat tels qu'ils ont
     été choisis par l'Offrant et indiqués dans le titre de ce Contrat
     : Paternité - Pas d'Utilisation Commerciale - Partage Des
     Conditions Initiales A l'Identique.
 .
 2. Exceptions aux droits exclusifs. Aucune disposition de ce contrat
 n'a pour intention de réduire, limiter ou restreindre les prérogatives
 issues des exceptions aux droits, de l'épuisement des droits ou
 d'autres limitations aux droits exclusifs des ayants droit selon le
 droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou les autres lois
 applicables.
 .
 3. Autorisation. Soumis aux termes et conditions définis dans cette
 autorisation, et ceci pendant toute la durée de protection de l'Oeuvre
 par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou le droit
 applicable, l'Offrant accorde à l'Acceptant l'autorisation mondiale
 d'exercer à titre gratuit et non exclusif les droits suivants :
 .
     reproduire l'Oeuvre, incorporer l'Oeuvre dans une ou plusieurs
     Oeuvres dites Collectives et reproduire l'Oeuvre telle
     qu'incorporée dans lesdites Oeuvres dites Collectives; créer et
     reproduire des Oeuvres dites Dérivées; distribuer des exemplaires
     ou enregistrements, présenter, représenter ou communiquer l'Oeuvre
     au public par tout procédé technique, y compris incorporée dans
     des Oeuvres Collectives; distribuer des exemplaires ou
     phonogrammes, présenter, représenter ou communiquer au public des
     Oeuvres dites Dérivées par tout procédé technique; lorsque
     l'Oeuvre est une base de données, extraire et réutiliser des
     parties substantielles de l'Oeuvre.
 .
 Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous les
 supports, médias, procédés techniques et formats. Les droits ci-dessus
 incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications nécessaires
 techniquement à l'exercice des droits dans d'autres formats et
 procédés techniques. L'exercice de tous les droits qui ne sont pas
 expressément autorisés par l'Offrant ou dont il n'aurait pas la
 gestion demeure réservé, notamment les mécanismes de gestion
 collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l'article 4(d).
 .
 4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'article 3 est
 expressément assujettie et limitée par le respect des restrictions
 suivantes :
 .
     L'Acceptant peut reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou
     communiquer au public l'Oeuvre y compris par voie numérique
     uniquement selon les termes de ce Contrat. L'Acceptant doit
     inclure une copie ou l'adresse Internet (Identifiant Uniforme de
     Ressource) du présent Contrat à toute reproduction ou
     enregistrement de l'Oeuvre que l'Acceptant distribue, représente
     ou communique au public y compris par voie numérique. L'Acceptant
     ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation de
     l'Oeuvre qui altèrent ou restreignent les termes du présent
     Contrat ou l'exercice des droits qui y sont accordés au
     bénéficiaire. L'Acceptant ne peut pas céder de droits sur
     l'Oeuvre. L'Acceptant doit conserver intactes toutes les
     informations qui renvoient à ce Contrat et à l'exonération de
     responsabilité. L'Acceptant ne peut pas reproduire, distribuer,
     représenter ou communiquer au public l'Oeuvre, y compris par voie
     numérique, en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d'accès
     ou de contrôle d'utilisation qui serait contradictoire avec les
     termes de cet Accord contractuel. Les mentions ci-dessus
     s'appliquent à l'Oeuvre telle qu'incorporée dans une Oeuvre dite
     Collective, mais, en dehors de l'Oeuvre en elle-même, ne
     soumettent pas l'Oeuvre dite Collective, aux termes du présent
     Contrat. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Collective, à la
     demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du possible,
     retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence au dit
     Offrant, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite
     Collective, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure
     du possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence
     au dit Auteur, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite
     Dérivée, à la demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du
     possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit
     Offrant, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite
     Dérivée, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure du
     possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit
     Auteur, comme demandé.  L'Acceptant peut reproduire, distribuer,
     représenter ou communiquer au public une Oeuvre dite Dérivée y
     compris par voie numérique uniquement sous les termes de ce
     Contrat, ou d'une version ultérieure de ce Contrat comprenant les
     mêmes Options du Contrat que le présent Contrat, ou un Contrat
     Creative Commons iCommons comprenant les mêmes Options du Contrat
     que le présent Contrat (par exemple Paternité - Pas d'Utilisation
     Commerciale - Partage Des Conditions Initiales A l'Identique 2.0
     Japon). L'Acceptant doit inclure une copie ou l'adresse Internet
     (Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource) du présent Contrat, ou d'un
     autre Contrat tel que décrit à la phrase précédente, à toute
     reproduction ou enregistrement de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée que
     l'Acceptant distribue, représente ou communique au public y
     compris par voie numérique. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou
     imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée qui
     altèrent ou restreignent les termes du présent Contrat ou
     l'exercice des droits qui y sont accordés au bénéficiaire, et doit
     conserver intactes toutes les informations qui renvoient à ce
     Contrat et à l'avertissement sur les garanties. L'Acceptant ne
     peut pas reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au
     public y compris par voie numérique l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée en
     utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d'accès ou de contrôle
     d'utilisation qui serait contradictoire avec les termes de cet
     Accord contractuel. Les mentions ci-dessus s'appliquent à l'Oeuvre
     dite Dérivée telle qu'incorporée dans une Oeuvre dite Collective,
     mais, en dehors de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée en elle-même, ne
     soumettent pas l'Oeuvre Collective, aux termes du présent Contrat.
     Si l'Acceptant reproduit, distribue, représente ou communique au
     public, y compris par voie numérique, l'Oeuvre ou toute Oeuvre
     dite Dérivée ou toute Oeuvre dite Collective, il doit conserver
     intactes toutes les informations sur le régime des droits et en
     attribuer la paternité à l'Auteur Original, de manière raisonnable
     au regard au médium ou au moyen utilisé. Il doit communiquer le
     nom de l'Auteur Original ou son éventuel pseudonyme s'il est
     indiqué ; le titre de l'Oeuvre Originale s'il est indiqué ; dans
     la mesure du possible, l'adresse Internet ou Identifiant Uniforme
     de Ressource (URI), s'il existe, spécifié par l'Offrant comme
     associé à l'Oeuvre, à moins que cette adresse ne renvoie pas aux
     informations légales (paternité et conditions d'utilisation de
     l'Oeuvre). Dans le cas d'une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, il doit indiquer
     les éléments identifiant l'utilisation l'Oeuvre dans l'Oeuvre dite
     Dérivée par exemple « Traduction anglaise de l'Oeuvre par l'Auteur
     Original » ou « Scénario basé sur l'Oeuvre par l'Auteur Original
     ». Ces obligations d'attribution de paternité doivent être
     exécutées de manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas d'une
     Oeuvre dite Dérivée ou d'une Oeuvre dite Collective, ces
     informations doivent, au minimum, apparaître à la place et de
     manière aussi visible que celles à laquelle apparaissent les
     informations de même nature.  Dans le cas où une utilisation de
     l'Oeuvre serait soumise à un régime légal de gestion collective
     obligatoire, l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter
     ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et
     de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la
     radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de
     phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de
     retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Oeuvres
     fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par
     reprographie.
 .
 5. Garantie et exonération de responsabilité
 .
     En mettant l'Oeuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de
         ce Contrat, l'Offrant déclare de bonne foi qu'à sa
         connaissance et dans les limites d'une enquête raisonnable :
         L'Offrant a obtenu tous les droits sur l'Oeuvre nécessaires
         pour pouvoir autoriser l'exercice des droits accordés par le
         présent Contrat, et permettre la jouissance paisible et
         l'exercice licite de ces droits, ceci sans que l'Acceptant
         n'ait aucune obligation de verser de rémunération ou tout
         autre paiement ou droits, dans la limite des mécanismes de
         gestion collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l'article
         4(e); L'Oeuvre n'est constitutive ni d'une violation des
         droits de tiers, notamment du droit de la propriété littéraire
         et artistique, du droit des marques, du droit de
         l'information, du droit civil ou de tout autre droit, ni de
         diffamation, de violation de la vie privée ou de tout autre
         préjudice délictuel à l'égard de toute tierce partie.  A
         l'exception des situations expressément mentionnées dans le
         présent Contrat ou dans un autre accord écrit, ou exigées par
         la loi applicable, l'Oeuvre est mise à disposition en l'état
         sans garantie d'aucune sorte, qu'elle soit expresse ou tacite,
         y compris à l'égard du contenu ou de l'exactitude de l'Oeuvre.
 .
 6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre
 public imposées par la loi applicable et des réparations imposées par
 le régime de la responsabilité vis-à-vis d'un tiers en raison de la
 violation des garanties prévues par l'article 5 du présent contrat,
 l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de
 l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie légale ni en raison d'aucun
 préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de
 l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Oeuvre, y
 compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la
 possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
 .
 7. Résiliation
 .
     Tout manquement aux termes du contrat par l'Acceptant entraîne la
     résiliation automatique du Contrat et la fin des droits qui en
     découlent. Cependant, le contrat conserve ses effets envers les
     personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de
     l'Acceptant, en exécution du présent contrat, la mise à
     disposition d'Oeuvres dites Dérivées, ou d'Oeuvres dites
     Collectives, ceci tant qu'elles respectent pleinement leurs
     obligations. Les sections 1, 2, 5, 6 et 7 du contrat continuent à
     s'appliquer après la résiliation de celui-ci.  Dans les limites
     indiquées ci-dessus, le présent Contrat s'applique pendant toute
     la durée de protection de l'Oeuvre selon le droit
     applicable. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit
     d'exploiter l'Oeuvre sous des conditions contractuelles
     différentes, ou d'en cesser la diffusion; cependant, le recours à
     cette option ne doit pas conduire à retirer les effets du présent
     Contrat (ou de tout contrat qui a été ou doit être accordé selon
     les termes de ce Contrat), et ce Contrat continuera à s'appliquer
     dans tous ses effets jusqu'à ce que sa résiliation intervienne
     dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
 .
 8. Divers
 .
     A chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie
     numérique de l'Oeuvre ou d'une Oeuvre dite Collective par
     l'Acceptant, l'Offrant propose au bénéficiaire une offre de mise à
     disposition de l'Oeuvre dans des termes et conditions identiques à
     ceux accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat.  A
     chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie numérique
     d'une Oeuvre dite Dérivée par l'Acceptant, l'Offrant propose au
     bénéficiaire une offre de mise à disposition du bénéficiaire de
     l'Oeuvre originale dans des termes et conditions identiques à ceux
     accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat.  La
     nullité ou l'inapplicabilité d'une quelconque disposition de ce
     Contrat au regard de la loi applicable n'affecte pas celle des
     autres dispositions qui resteront pleinement valides et
     applicables. Sans action additionnelle par les parties à cet
     accord, lesdites dispositions devront être interprétées dans la
     mesure minimum nécessaire à leur validité et leur applicabilité.
     Aucune limite, renonciation ou modification des termes ou
     dispositions du présent Contrat ne pourra être acceptée sans le
     consentement écrit et signé de la partie compétente.  Ce Contrat
     constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l'Oeuvre
     mise ici à disposition. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord
     supplémentaire ou mandat portant sur cette Oeuvre en dehors des
     éléments mentionnés ici. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune
     disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une
     quelconque communication en provenance de l'Acceptant. Ce Contrat
     ne peut être modifié sans l'accord mutuel écrit de l'Offrant et de
     l'Acceptant.  Le droit applicable est le droit français.
 .
 Creative Commons n'est pas partie à ce Contrat et n'offre aucune forme
 de garantie relative à l'Oeuvre. Creative Commons décline toute
 responsabilité à l'égard de l'Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel
 que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit
 le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui
 surviendrait en rapport avec le présent Contrat. Cependant, si
 Creative Commons s'est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour
 mettre une Oeuvre à disposition selon les termes de ce Contrat,
 Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d'un
 Offrant.
 .
 A l'exception des fins limitées à informer le public que l'Oeuvre est
 mise à disposition sous CPCC, aucune des parties n'utilisera la marque
 « Creative Commons » ou toute autre indication ou logo afférent sans
 le consentement préalable écrit de Creative Commons. Toute utilisation
 autorisée devra être effectuée en conformité avec les lignes
 directrices de Creative Commons à jour au moment de l'utilisation,
 telles qu'elles sont disponibles sur son site Internet ou sur simple

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

     intended for use by those authorized to give the public

     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to

     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
  a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and
 .
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
 .
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
 .
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.
 .
            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
 .
                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
  b. ShareAlike.
 .
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
 .
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

     License.

 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
 .
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
 .
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

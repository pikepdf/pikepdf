Working with interactive forms
==============================

Pikepdf provides two interfaces for working with interactive forms. There is a low-level 
interface, `pikepdf.AcroForm`, which is exposed as the `pikepdf.Pdf.acroform` property. 
There is also a higher-level interface available in the `pikepdf.form` module, which 
provides several abstractions to make usage easier.

Extracting Form Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is relatively easy to extract basic form data from a PDF.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pikepdf.form import Form

    >>> form = Form(pdf)

    >>> data = {}

    >>> for field_name, field in form.items():
    ...    if field.is_text or field.is_choice or field.is_radio_button:
    ...        data[field_name] = field.value
    ...    elif field.is_checkbox:
    ...        data[field_name] = field.checked


Inspecting the Form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The form allows retrieving specific named fields via dict-like access. There are several 
useful properties common to all fields. The most useful of these are:

* ``alternate_name``, which is a human-readable label for the field.
* ``fully_qualified_name``, which is the machine-readable key which identifies this field
* ``is_required``
* ``is_text``
* ``is_checkbox``
* ``is_radio_button``
* ``is_pushbutton``
* ``is_choice``

.. code-block:: python

    >>> field = form['MyField']

    >>> field.fully_qualified_name
    "MyField"

    >>> field.alternate_name
    "Applicant's first given name"

    >>> field.is_text
    True

    >>> field.is_required
    False


Filling Form Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before filling a form, you will need to determine how you will deal with appearance 
streams. In addition to merely holding values, PDF form fields must explicitly declare 
how the filled-in value should look. This is known as the appearance stream. There are 
several options available.

First, you may choose not to generate appearance streams at all. Most full-fat PDF readers 
are capable of generating these appearance streams themselves, so depending on your use 
case it may be acceptable to leave appearance stream generation to the end-user 
application. This is the default behavior of the `pikepdf.form.Form` class.

If you do need or want to generate appearance streams, you must provide the class you wish
to use to accomplish this task. There are two possible implementations provided with
Pikepdf: `pikepdf.form.DefaultAppearanceStreamGenerator` and 
`pikepdf.form.ExtendedAppearanceStreamGenerator`. To use either of these, simply pass 
the class as the second argument to the constructor:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pikepdf.form import Form, DefaultAppearanceStreamGenerator

    >>> form = Form(pdf, DefaultAppearanceStreamGenerator)

The differences between these two options is explained in the documentation for each class.

Lastly, you may implement your own class for generating appearance streams that better 
fits your specific use case. It must implement the interface provided by 
`pikepdf.form.AppearanceStreamGenerator`.

After filling a form, you may also wish to flatten it. This converts the interactive form 
fields into normal, un-editable text. This can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    pdf.flatten_annotations()

Generating appearance streams is required if you wish to flatten the form.


Text Fields
-----------

Text fields can either resemble an HTML text input, or an HTML textarea, as well as a 
password field, file upload, or rich text input. Pikepdf supports only the first two 
options, which can be distinguished from one another using the ``is_multiline`` property.

The underlying value of the text field is stored in the ``value`` property. The field 
may also have a ``default_value`` which should be used when resetting the form.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> text_field = form['MyTextField']

    >>> text_field.is_multiline
    False

    >>> text_field.default_value
    ''

    >>> text_field.value
    ''

    >>> text_field.max_length
    75

    >>> text_field.value = "Hello World!"


Checkbox Fields
---------------

Checkbox fields behave somewhat similarly to what you might be familiar with working with 
HTML forms in JavaScript. There is a ``checked`` property which will tell you if the box 
is checked or not. If access to the underlying value is needed, it can be fetched via the 
``value`` property.

Unlike HTML checkboxes, however, there is a value for both the on *and* off states, and 
thus ``value`` will return different values depending on if the box is checked or not. The 
value for an off state will be a `pikepdf.Name` with the value "/Off". The value for the 
on state is variable, and can be retrieved from the ``on_value`` property.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> checkbox_field = form['MyCheckbox']

    >>> checkbox.checked
    False

    >>> checkbox.value
    pikepdf.Name("/Off")

    >>> checkbox.on_value
    pikepdf.Name("/Yes")

    >> checkbox.states
    (pikepdf.Name("/Yes"), pikepdf.Name("/Off"))

    >>> checkbox.checked = True

    >>> checkbox.value
    pikepdf.Name("/Yes")
    

Radio Button Groups
-------------------

A radio button group is constrained to a finite list of allowed values, which are all 
`pikepdf.Name` objects. The list of allowed values can be obtained via the ``states`` 
property.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> radio_group = form['MyRadioButtonGroup']

    >>> radio_group.states
    (pikepdf.Name("/1"), pikepdf.Name("/2"), pikepdf.Name("/3"))

    >>> radio_group.value
    None

    >>> radio_group.value = pikepdf.Name("/1")


Radio buttons are returned as a group rather than as individual buttons, though 
representations of the individual buttons can be obtained by way of the ``options`` 
property. You can set the selection option via the group's ``selected`` property, or via 
the button's ``select`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> radio_group.options[0].checked
    True

    >>> radio_group.options[1].on_value
    pikepdf.Name("/2")

    >>> radio_group.options[1].states
    (pikepdf.Name("/2"), pikepdf.Name("/Off"))

    >>> radio_group.selected = radio_group.options[1]

    >>> radio_group.value
    pikepdf.Name("/2")

    >>> radio_group.options[2].select()

    >>> radio_group.value
    pikepdf.Name("/3")


Choice Fields
-------------

Choice fields may be either list boxes or comboboxes, as determined by the ``is_combobox`` 
property. If the field is a combobox, it may optionally have an editable text box attached 
to it, as shown by the ``allows_edit`` property. Editable choice fields may store 
arbitrary values, but otherwise choice fields are limited to those options which are 
returned via the ``options`` property.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> field = form['MyChoiceField']

    >>> field.is_combobox
    True

    >>> field.allows_edit
    False

    >>> field.options[0].display_name
    "Pike"

    >>> field.options[2].select()

    >>> field.value
    "Trout"

    >>> field.value = "Pike"


Signature Fields
----------------

Pikepdf does not support signature fields, but does include a utility function to stamp an 
image over the top of the field's bounding box. The stamped image must be a PDF.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> form_pdf = Pdf.open(...)

    >>> sig_pdf = Pdf.open(...)

    >>> form = Form(form_pdf)

    >>> form['MySigField'].stamp_overlay(sig_pdf.pages[0])

To stamp an image that is not already a PDF, you will need to use an image processing 
library, such as `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to convert it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from PIL import Image

    >>> img = Image.open(img).convert('RGB')

    >>> img_as_pdf = BytesIO()

    >>> img.save(img_as_pdf, 'pdf')

    >>> img_as_pdf.seek(0)

    >>> sig_pdf = Pdf.open(img_as_pdf)

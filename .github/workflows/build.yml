      # pass on whichever succeeds first. So we sit here and wait for the second one if
      # it hasn't finished yet. Cirrus CI might decide to run them sequentially so we
      # could be waiting for up to a whole build time. Allow one hour.

      # on both Cirrus CI and GitHub Actions, but that would be a lot of duplication.

      # waiting our specific check.
